= Loganon

loganon is a generic log anonymizer. It expects an input, an output and a rules
file. A rules file contains search and replace patterns (regular expresssions).

This repository contains 'loganon', the command to anonymize log files. It also
contains `loganon.sh` a script to be called from a logrotate configuration and
an example rules file `mail.rules` (for Postfix and Dovecot).

== Contributions welcome!

Each programm has its own way of logging. If you use 'loganon' and if you create
a rule file for an application 'loganon' doesn't cover yet, consider to
contribute it. Each contribution makes 'loganon' more useful.
